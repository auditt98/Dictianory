#TODOS

* Take a look into another way to store data(File serialization) instead of using dbms
* Do some research on Trie structure
* Properly implement autosuggest or find a way to fix AccessViolationException
* If none of the fixes work, try making my own Control?
* Worth looking into UserControl for that
* Fix some entries in the database at "get.+" (Problem with word extraction, try to use .Remove())
*
